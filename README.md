## Description

This contract implements simple counter backed by storage on blockchain.
Contract in `contract/src/lib.rs` provides methods to increment / decrement counter and get it's current value or reset.

Plus and minus buttons increase and decrease value correspondingly. When button L is toggled, a little light turns on, just for fun. RS button is for reset. LE and RE buttons to let the robot wink at you.
